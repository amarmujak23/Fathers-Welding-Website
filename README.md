Redesigning SM MetalWorks' online presence, I created an elegant user interface for my dad's welding business.
The challenge was to balance usefulness with aesthetics with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It was challenging to integrate responsive design, but once it was done, the platform was aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly, showcasing the artistry of SM MetalWorks. 
Currently, making a new site with React.
